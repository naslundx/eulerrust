# Project Euler solutions in Rust

## Description

This project contains my solutions to Project Euler problems, implemented in Rust.

Link to the problems: [https://projecteuler.net/archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

Solutions may not always be the most optimal. Instead, the focus is on readability and learning and clean code.

## Running

To run a solution for a specific problem, you need rust (2021 edition or newer) and the following command:

```sh
cargo run -- N
```

where `N` is the ID of the problem you want to solve.

## Progress

As of now, most of the first 50 problems have been solved.

The solutions might change over time as I learn more and improve my Rust skills.
